# Shopping Cart - PHP
My solution to a simple PHP application for a Shopping Cart.

## Give it a go by following these requirements
* The cart needs to maintain it's state during page loads and refreshes.
* A list of products to sell should be listed at all times to allow adding of products.
* Must be able to add a product to the cart.
* Must be able to view current products in the cart.
* Cart products should be listed in this format: product name, price, quantity, total, remove product link
* All products in the cart should be tallied to get an overall total.
* Must show all prices to 2 decimal places.
* Adding an existing product to an existing cart should only update the product quantity, instead of creating a new product.
* The application should work in PHP 5.3 or above.
* Challenge: if you are reasonably competent in PHP, try to complete this task in around 1 to 2 hours. For beginners, feel free to take your time to learn and understand PHP.

Follow this template for the list of products to sell:
```
$products = array(
    array("name" => "Coke", "price" => 8.99),
    array("name" => "Pepsi", "price" => 1.60),
    array("name" => "Fanta", "price" => 7.89),
    array("name" => "Sprite", "price" => 1.9),
    array("name" => "Dr Pepper", "price" => 18.65)
);
```

Happy Coding!
